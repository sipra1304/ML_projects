## Breast Cancer Prediction using Decision Trees

### Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of breast cancer using decision tree classifiers. By analyzing various features of cell nuclei present in a breast mass, the model classifies whether the mass is benign or malignant.

### Highlights
- **Algorithm**: Decision Tree Classifier
- **Dataset**: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib
- **Steps**:
  1. Data loading and preprocessing
  2. Feature selection
  3. Model training and evaluation
  4. Visualization of decision tree

### Usage
Navigate to the `breast_cancer_prediction` directory and run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to see the implementation.

## Cerebral Stroke Prediction using SMOTE

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of cerebral strokes using a combination of oversampling techniques (SMOTE) to handle class imbalance and various machine learning models.

### Highlights
- **Techniques**: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)
- **Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine
- **Dataset**: Stroke Prediction Dataset
- **Libraries**: imbalanced-learn, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn
- **Steps**:
  1. Data preprocessing and exploration
  2. Handling class imbalance with SMOTE
  3. Model training and comparison
  4. Evaluation and interpretation of results

### Usage
Navigate to the `cerebral_stroke_prediction` directory and run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to explore the implementation.

## Text Summarization using NLTK

### Overview
This project implements text summarization techniques using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to condense large documents into shorter summaries while retaining the essential information.

### Highlights
- **Library**: Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- **Methods**: Extractive Summarization
- **Dataset**: Custom text documents
- **Steps**:
  1. Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop words removal, etc.)
  2. Sentence scoring and ranking
  3. Summary generation

### Usage
Navigate to the `text_summarization` directory and run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to see the text summarization in action.
